# Automated-Collectorate
District collector magistrate system is an application which is developed to automate the processes at the collector office in a district. This application is designed to manage all the related information in a systematic manner. In the present scenario all the information is maintained in files and ledgers. It is difficult to
manage the data efficiently and it is often difficult to search and retrieve the necessary data. Data
is often mismanaged and this leads to loss of data. People in need of services have to approach
the office and get the things done.
The proposed system is a web-based application. It stores the entire information in a centralized
database. This makes it possible to manage the data efficiently and effectively. The system
allows users to interact with the application and execute various operations, by providing welldefined interfaces. The system also allows generation of reports.
